# jWebProfile
Data collection and extraction tool; Harvest twitter data on your local disk;

jWebProfile allows you to combine Twitter and Github data belonging to others and create a "virtual profile" on your local machine.
It also allows you to harvest Twitter data (such as Tweets and other meta data related to those Tweets) on your local machine and create a dataset for 
Twitter analysis.

NOTE: If you are interested in browsing through the source code, you will be seeing the most unstructured code format on the internet today. Sorry for that. In my future projects, I will make sure I'll do a proper documentation and organize the code properly. This project was done in a short period of time. I hope you understand.
